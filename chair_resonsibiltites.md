# PenCHORD Chair Responsibilities

Note: The primary point of decision-making, and work management (such as accepting new work), in PenCHORD will be at workstream level; only decisions that cannot be made at workstream level will be managed at a higher level (and we aim to use whole team consensus as much as possible for team-wide decisions). This follows the principle of subsidiarity, where decisions are made at the lowest competent level. Also, the Chair is not the line manager of the group; line management (such as appraisal/career progression discussions) continues to follow the existing line management structure.

The PenCHORD Chair will usually have a full time role performing research/teaching activities, so the Chair role is necessarily minimal (which is possible as the large majority of work and people management will occur at the workstream level).

Below is a list of responsibilities of the PenCHORD Chair (who is expected to be in place for a 6 month period).

## Culture

* Encourage a culture of calm, focused, high value work. *“Do Few Things Well”.*
* Encourage a culture of "*nurturing the vision*" - work slowly and steadily towards a clear goal/vision.
- To cultivate and actively facilitate an environment in which all parties feel emotionally safe and able to communicate openly.
- Ensure responsibility for the well-being of the team as a unit, and act as a point of contact for whole team well-being issues.
- Support and encourage work-stream leads; help identify how to overcome blocks to progress where needed and possible.    
- Champion the [strategy of the team](management_proposal_jan_2024.md), and encourage working practices within the team that ensure and foster focus, promote development opportunities, and prioritise well-being.
- Champion and support flexible working practices within the team.

## Point of contact and PenCHORD representation

- Be a point of contact within the team should anyone wish to raise any group-wide issues, questions or proposals.
- Be a first visible point of contact for people outside of the team where people might not know which workstream lead is best to contact.
- Ensure that at least one PenCHORD workstream leader attends the PenARC leadership meetings to ensure any relevant discussions are communicated to the group, including (but in no way limited to) team building or professional development opportunities.
- Champion the work of the group both internally (within PenARC / the wider university) and externally. In conjunction with other members or work stream leads, ensure the needs and/or skills of the group and wider ARC are represented appropriately and as necessary and possible at internal/external, local/national forums (volunteers will be sought for these forums, with support from the ARC Executive Group, in line with professional development aspirations for people or the team, to ensure long-term funding of the ARC).
- Act as a “gatekeeper” to requests from the wider university or other stakeholders to utilise academic resources within the team, and protect those within the team from demands on time that do not align with team and PenARC core strategy or individual development ambitions (such as teaching, or taking on projects where the main goal is personal development of a team member). When unsure, or more resources are required from the ARC to undertake the work, the Chair or workstream lead, will escalate the query to the ARC Executive Group.
- Consult with workstream leads and the ARC Executive on long-term plans to increase PenCHORD capacity for both applied research and NHS capacity building (e.g. growing HSMA).
    
## Process

- Esure team meetings (management + tutorial/discussion) are organised to take place every 2 months (the Chair will ensure these meetings are chaired, but may not necessarily chair them themselves).
- Where consensus cannot be reached in team-wide discussion or, failing that, between workstream leads, and if the decision is outside the scope of line management, the Chair may make the final decision, in discussion with ARC Executive Group as where appropriate. This should be a rare event.
- The Chair will ensure that the ARC Executive Group are informed when opportunities, accepted or rejected, impact positively or negatively on overarching strategic ARC aims, or when opportunities would require further resources from the ARC to achieve. This will also be recorded in a “Chair’s Log”.
## Considering, and planning for, new work

The primary point of Work In Progress (WIP) control is the Workstream lead (WIP at group level is controlled by the number of workstreams). Though not at all mandatory, people may find the **STOP** (situation, target, options, proposal/plan) method a simple and effective framework for thinking through new work:

**STOP** (don't rush into anything), pause, and take any artificial urgency out of the situation.

**Situation**: What problem, strategic goal, or new opportunity are you addressing? Write the current situation down clearly.

**Target**: What are you trying to achieve? The target should be written down such that it is very easy to identify when it has been achieved. What is the objective? What are the timelines? What are the desired specific outputs? What is the value being generated, and to whom? Does someone value the work enough to pay for it to be done? How does it align with priorities? Does the work generate, or lead to, income, academic output, and/or impact? This phase may take some time to clarify.

**Options**: What are the options of getting from Situation to Target? Don't just go with the first thing that presented itself. You can make yourselves find at least 3 options to achieve the desired target (some people say 7 to force more inventive options). Groups are always better than individuals here. And you should always have one top option of "Don't do it". Also consider the required resources, and who is providing (paying for) them. Don't start new work just because it may be useful. Does it reach the "Hell, yes - we really should do this!" barrier, and can you take it on now  without disturbing other work? If starting this work will make other work go slower, consider putting this new work in a queue, and start it when resources are freed up by the completion of other work (but keep any queue for new work limited in length; consider which other queued project in a queue could be cancelled if this new work provides a better opportunity or is more critical to solve).  

*When considering options, Edward de Bono’s Six Thinking Hats is a well established, and effective method, for generating and considering options. Spend time ‘wearing’ each hat before moving on to another hat (yes, it sounds cheesy, but it works): [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats)

**Proposal/Plan**: Choose which option to progress and work out a general plan to achieve the target (and be clear on resources needed), or record why no further action is being taken. Do you have the resources now, or does this join a queue of planned work?
